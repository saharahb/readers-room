# Reader's Room

## A book logging system.

### What will the application do?

Reader's room is a book logging system that will allow users to create their
own personal libraries. Each book will have a title, author, genre, and length. Users may leave ratings and reviews for 
books that they have read, as well as create a book wish list, for books that they want to read. The application will also
generate statistics for users based on the number of pages, genres, and authors they read.
