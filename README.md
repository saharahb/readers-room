# Reader's Room

## A book logging system.

### What will the application do?

Reader's room is a book logging system that will allow users to create their
own personal libraries. Each book will have a title, author, genre, and length. Users may leave ratings and reviews for 
books that they have read, as well as create a book wish list, for books that they want to read. The application will also
generate statistics for users based on the number of pages, genres, and authors they read.

### Who will use this application?

Avid readers and beginners alike may be interested in Reader's Room. This tool aims to motivate and engage with readers of all levels.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

My favourite hobby is reading, and I enjoy keeping track of my reading data. Creating this tool will give me a space to 
store all of this data and share my ratings and reviews with friends.
